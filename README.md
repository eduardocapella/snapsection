SnapSection allows users to swift share specific sections from your article or blog post.

## Description
SnapSection is a WordPress plugin that enables swift sharing of specific sections from your article or blog post. It appends the `id` attribute of the `h3` element to your page's URL. Consequently, any user who clicks the link will be directed straight to this specific section of your page or post.

## How does it work?
SnapSection scans every `h3` (third-level heading) element across your website's pages and posts, checking for an `id`. If it doesn't find one, it generates an `id` based on the `h3` text.

Once an `id` is assigned, users can share the link to a specific `h3` by hovering over it and clicking the displayed icon. Users who access the shared URL will be directed to the corresponding section of your post or article.
